## Contributing to this repo

This repository is managed by EasyCLA. Project participants must sign the free ([GraphQL Specification Membership agreement](https://preview-spec-membership.graphql.org) before making a contribution. You only need to do this one time, and it can be signed by [individual contributors](http://individual-spec-membership.graphql.org/) or their [employers](http://corporate-spec-membership.graphql.org/).

To initiate the signature process please open a PR against this repo. The EasyCLA bot will block the merge if we still need a membership agreement from you.

You can find [detailed information here](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/tree/main/membership). If you have issues, please email [operations@graphql.org](mailto:operations@graphql.org).
